IMAGEN data are available by application to consortium coordinator Dr Schumann (http://imagen-europe.com) after evaluation according to an established procedure. We would like to thanks to the ADHD-200 Consortium (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/) for their generosity in contributing data publicly available.

SUMMARY ï¼ˆMatlab2018b; SPSS22.0; R3.5.1)

Step 1: Estimated the SSRT (stop signal reaction time) and the ISV (intra-subject variability) from the behavioural data of the SST (stop signal task). (S1_SSRT_ISV_preprocess.m)

Step 2: Analysis of the IMAGEN sample  (S2_Analysis_IMAGEN.m)
      
      Step 2.1 Whole-brain voxel-wise association of GMV with ADHD scores (total; hyperactivity/inhibition; inattentive) using the GLM in SPM12.
      
      Step 2.2 Partial correlation analysis between GMV of the signifciant clusters and both the cognitive (WM: working memory; SSRT: response inhibition; ISV: attention regulation) and the motivational (Kirby rate: delay discounting) dysfunctions.  
      
      Step 2.3 Hierarchical multiple regression using the SPSS22.0.
      
      Step 2.4. Correlation with ADHD PRS score. The PRS score was estiamted using PRSice; http://prsice.info/. 
      
      Step 2.5. Comparison between the participants with persistent ADHD symptoms and the symptom-free participants. To match the sample size between the persistent group and thee control group, we also used the R package MatchIt.(S2.5.1_Find_matchSample.R)
      
Step 3:  Analysis of ADHD200. (S3_Analysis_ADHD200.m)

     Step 3.1 Group comparison.
     Step 3.2 Estimating the medication effect by bootstrap.
